Find & Seek

Abstract: 

 Find & Seek is an AI-powered search and rescue platform that helps first responders, 911 operators, and government agencies locate missing persons using AI-driven person detection, footage analysis, and an interactive mapping system.

Audience - 911 Operators/First Responders

1. Case File & Report Integration
Ability to upload police reports, Amber Alerts, and case files to auto-extract key details (e.g., descriptions, last known locations, timestamps).
NLP processing using Groq Whisper to convert reports into structured search queries.
2. AI-Assisted Image Matching
Upload images of victims/perpetrators to search for similar matches using AI-powered facial recognition and object detection. 
Cross-check existing footage & database images for potential matches.
3. Search Radius Enhancements
Time-Based Adjustments: Automatically updates search radius based on elapsed time since last sighting (wider for vehicles, localized for pedestrians).
Contextual AI Movement Prediction: Uses prior movement patterns and estimated speed to predict likely locations.
4. Interactive Map Enhancements (Mapbox)
Dynamic CAM Pins: Ability to click on a pin and view AI-analyzed pre-recorded footage along with a timestamped detection log.
Heatmaps & Path Tracking: Highlight high-probability areas based on reports and AI movement predictions.
Geofencing Alerts: If a detected person enters/exits a critical area, notify operators.
5. Smart Search & Filters
Groq Autocorrect & NLP Search Bar to refine queries based on descriptions, reports, and voice input.
Search by Attributes (e.g., clothing color, height, vehicle type).
Cross-reference multiple search terms (e.g., 'red jacket' + 'black SUV' + 'last seen in downtown').
6. Live Alerts & Operator Dashboard
Real-time AI Alerts for new matches, high-confidence detections, and search area updates.
Case Management Dashboard for tracking multiple missing persons cases in one place.
Incident Timeline View: Chronological order of detections, reports, and alerts to provide a visual story.
7. Image & Video Processing
AI-Based Upscaling (Optional): Improve low-quality images for better identification.
Motion Analysis: Identify movement direction and patterns from video footage.
8. Welcome & Onboarding Page
Quick access to recent cases and active alerts.
User roles (911 Operators, Law Enforcement, SAR Teams) for tailored views and permissions.
